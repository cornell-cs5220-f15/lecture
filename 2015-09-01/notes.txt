0.  Logistics

 - Ice-breaker: Run through counting protocol again

 - HW0
   - Still some missing (24/114) -- turn it in!
   - Show breakdown re architecture

 - Git and PR
   - If you're lost come to OH -- or ask a friend!
   - There's a post by Colin on Git+GitHub -- also see reading page
   - You will want to keep your fork of the lecture Q up-to-date:

       https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/

 - Cluster
   - All should be able to login, have home dirs
   - module load cs5220 gets base configuration (incl git 2)
   - Still working on a few things (ssh to Phi, gcc 4.9.2/4.9.3)
   - Q: Audio working for everyone who wants it?

 - membench timing
   - Uses OpenMP primitives for timing -- missing from Apple Clang!
   - Should work with recent GCC on whatever machine

1.  Revisit weak scaling / Gustafson

  - What is the "serial time" (hint: it's a projected time)?
  - There are other types: time-constrained scaling, error-based scaling

2.  Theoretical peak flop rate breakdown - ref slides

 - Haswell architecture (same as laptop)
 - Phi architecture?

3.  Q4 -- show dependency graph, longest dependency chain

4.  Mini-lecture -- sketch what membench is doing on the board

5.  Group exercise -- look at membench plots

 - Commentary: Matplotlib, Seaborn, other vis
 - Commentary: how to do timing
 - Analysis of features on my laptop
 - Analysis of features on totient cluster

6.  Group exercise -- centroid.

 - Commentary: How to time?  Set up framework and push.
 - Theoretical peak (ignoring memory)?
 - Theoretical peak with cold cache?
 - Order of sums and artificial dependency
